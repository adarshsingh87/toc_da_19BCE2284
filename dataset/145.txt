Swvl claims only names, email addresses, and phone numbers were accessed

Swvl, a bus-booking app and operator of bus routes in Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan, has been struck by a data breach.
The company, based in Cairo, became aware of “unauthorized access to its IT infrastructure” on the evening of July 3, according to a security alert.
An ongoing investigation into the breach has so far concluded that the compromised data “is restricted to names, email addresses, and phone numbers” and that “passwords and credit card information were not affected or exposed”.
“At this stage, there is no evidence that any of our customers have been directly impacted,” the alert reads.
The investigation “immediately identified and addressed specific vulnerabilities that our IT infrastructure may have had”, continued the notice. “Our IT environment has been fully secured”.
In response to queries from The Daily Swig, Swvl did not divulge how its IT systems may have been compromised nor how many individuals’ data may have been affected.

Swivl says it has, or is, undertaking the following security measures:
A spokesperson for the company told The Daily Swig that it had notified customers of the breach through the app, while the alert said that it would contact customers individually if they have been directly impacted.
Swvl has urged customers to update their account passwords and those of any other accounts with the same or similar passwords, and to change their passwords regularly.
“As ever, we continue to learn from this experience and are continually monitoring our systems, building and enhancing our security fences, and reacting immediately to potential threats,” the company said.
Swvl, which was founded in Egypt in 2017, plans to launch bus routes in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh by the end of the year.

The recent steps however, triggered by political challenges and health risks, signal some early and feeble attempts at a return of the state, or at the very least preserving the semblance of the old order, the shadow of a nation-state, amidst the dark fluidity and chaos surging from there to Kurdistan.

It took the Lebanese 40 years and external pressures to begin to think about getting their house in order, if that is indeed what is happening today.

Hopefully, it won't take their neighbours that long to start to address the necessary basics of life.re indeed everywhere in Lebanon. In Beirut, and in every village and town one visits. Flights from Beirut to Europe are one-third to half full of Syrians. Indeed,  given this massive presence and Lebanon's already poor infrastructure and socio-economic state, it is an achievement that the Syrian crisis has not led to further deterioration in the country.

The relations in Lebanon between the two peoples, despite some racism and ugly incidents, could have been far worse. Until now,  Lebanese hosting of the refugees is characterised by neither generosity nor enmity, but by a passive acceptance of fate.

This is partially driven by the fact that Syrians are culturally and linguistically akin, and some sectors of the Lebanese economy, e.g  construction, remain highly dependent on Syrian workers. How this will square with the new visa rules is unknown.

More importantly, this step can be seen as part of a series of recent indirect actions that attempt to strengthen the Lebanese state, or at least make the pretense of doing so. Minister of Health Abu Faour has been on an intense and mediatic campaign to clean up the
