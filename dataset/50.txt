“Through that investigation, we determined that this incident may have impacted certain job application and employment-related information.”
The spokesperson added: “There have been no business interruptions as we have worked to address this matter. We have implemented additional safeguards relating to data security and regret any concern or inconvenience this incident may cause.”
The breach has raised eyebrows for the sheer quantity and sensitivity of the data involved.
As software consultant Allen Holub points out on Twitter: “Why does the HR system need passport numbers or the password to your bank account? I can’t imagine a scenario where that sort of information should be stored in an HR system.”
And, says security pro Troy Hunt: “Time to just start life again when that much personal data is leaked.”
